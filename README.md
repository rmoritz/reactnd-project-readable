# Readable Project

This is my submission for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux
course.

## Running

To start the app:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, start the front-end
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
